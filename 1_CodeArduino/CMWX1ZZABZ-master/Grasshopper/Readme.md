**Grasshopper** is a small (0.71 " x 1.76") development board with Murata's CMWX1ZZABZ-078 FCC certified module containing ST Microelectronics' STM32L082 32 MHz Cortex M0+ MCU with 192 kByte of flash and 20 kBytes of RAM and Semtech's SX1276 LoRa radio. The development board exposes 19 GPIOs to the user as well as 3V3, GND, VIN, and VREF (for the analog sector), has an indicator led on GPIO 13 as well as a power-on led that can be disabled via a solder jumper for lowest power usage, and has an on-board antenna suitable for either 868 or 915 MHz.

Grasshopper [power consumption](https://hackaday.io/project/35169-hackable-cmwx1zzabz-lora-devices/log/78179-grasshopper-power-usage) is proportional to the CPU clock speed chosen and just 2 uA in stop mode. That's ultra-low power!
