**LoRaSensorTile**
Added the capability to detect wake on any motion and sleep on no motion using the BMA280 accelerometer. The wake and sleep states are used to determine the frequency of activity in the sketch. There is a no-motion timer that will carry out the activity infrequently, like say once an hour or once a day, and there is a in-motion timer that will carry out the activity when motion is detected. This way when the device experiences no motion, presumably due to nothing interesting happening, the data is collected and sent via LoRaWAN at longer intervals to minimize power usage while when motion is detected, presumably an interesting event to track, the data is sent at the higher frequency rate. This has a lot of uses. For example, one could create a motion-activated camera, keep track of or alert when a door or cabinet is opened, when a car or bike is moving, a mailbox is opened, etc. The motion-activation allows the device to expend the least amount of energy (~12 uA is the stop current of the LoRaSensorTile) most of the time while gathering data, sending data, actuating circuits, etc at an appropriate rate when the expected event(s) occur.
